# HTML canvas 2D game engine

## About

I challenged myself to create a 2D game engine with HTML5 canvas and vanilla ES6 JavaScript, even though my professional expertise is far from game development. The goal was to practice with HTML5 canvas, and JavaScript and implement some 2D games technics I heard some time ago.

Fun fact. This project was inspired by [the Code and Magic](https://github.com/htmlacademy/code-and-magic-demo) demo project from the JavaScript course of [HTMLacademy](https://htmlacademy.ru/) which I worked with as a mentor.

## Live version

Available at GitHub pages: <https://mr9d.github.io/wizard-of-the-code/> (deployed from the `master` branch)

## Running locally

If you want to run the application locally, you can do the following:

- `git clone` the repository
- Open `index.html` in the browser

That’s it, no build required.

## How to play

### Goal

The game has no objective. If you need a challenge, you can find the second flag marker at the top of the tower.

### Controls

Left/Right – move.

Alt – jump.

Ctrl – fire (not implemented yet).

### Level

You can change the game level in any way by modifying the [script/game/level.js](/script/game/level.js) file.
